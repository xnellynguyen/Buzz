## General questions [25 points]

1. How well did the team meet the requirements of this sprint?
    * I think on the aspect of artifacts, we all did really well working together by planning and getting those done earlier in the week.
    * By getting the artifacts done early, each member was able to dive into their own components to fully understand how they work and what stage it is currently in. They were also able to start planning out their next steps in Sprint 9.
1. When is the team gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * We are meeting with Ayon in person Friday morning at 11:35 am.
    * We also met as a team outside of class time late Tuesday night in the CITL.  
1. Report on each member's progress (phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * Jesus (Web) : Created mocks, user stories, and unit tests, and is getting comfortable with the flutter code that he inherited!
    * Nelly (Backend) : Added routes, updated system diagrams and ERDs, and is learning how to incorporate Google Authentication as well as slowly getting used to the backend code and implementing some simple planning aspects.
    * Riley (Admin) : Added tables, user stories, and unit tests as well as helped update the system diagrams and ERDs, she is getting used to the admin code as well as slowly implementing the planning aspects with the different tables we will need.
1. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"  
    * I believe the code reviews went well as if the member has made progress in their code this week, they walked me through the new code with their comments and described how it will correlate with the overall app and its intended use!
    * By showing me their written code, I could see if their "status" matched up to what I expected! Which I believe they all did!  
1. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * I think we all knew what was expected this time around after phase 1, so we all decided to meet earlier in the week to knock out the artifacts, and from there I just encouraged everyone to get them done and given to me so it is less stress later in the week. But overall, it was a joint effor to work "sooner rather than later".
1. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * I think I planned in Trello and in our meetings we discussed the artifacts or pieces of planning that are best if two specific roles work together on it. Also the people who may have had that role last phase was an integral part in helping smooth the change by giving their insight.
1. How well is the team communicating?
    * I think as a whole we are communicating very well! We know what is expected of us now, and we understand it is better to work early and together than scramble everything together over the weekend!
1. What expectations have you set for one another, if any? Highlight any changes.
    * I am not sure if we have set verbal or written expectations for each other, but I think we all expect for everyone to put their best effort forward and communicate if troubles are arising or if unable to put as much time in a certain week due to other workload.
1. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please itemize and briefly describe the challenge, its status (resolved or unresolved), and critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * If anything was challenging, I would say it was just the volume of progress for this phase and disecting it all to break down what exactly we want our Buzz to do and who needs to do exactly what, or who needs to collaborate with who.
    * Unclear: I would say the way in which this phase was presented to us in lecture and how it is described in the documentation could be unclear, because we may be told things that aren't specifically included in this phase, but is still necessary to understand.


## Project Management [25 points]
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We met with Ayon on Friday morning at 11:35 am for about 30 minutes, due to classes for some group members.
1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * I laid out the video requirements and design requirements on the Trello board that was given to us in the deliverables. I also broke down each roles specific duties that they need to complete for this sprint.
1. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * We conduct team meetings collaboratively, working together to complete diagrams or talk about how we want to plan implementation. Outside the meetings we were open on discussing issues we were facing or topics we didn't understand in our new roles.
1. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?
    * We checked in every class meeting as well as a outside of class meeting that we planned and created a timeline for ourselves. We used Trello to clearly outline each roles expected deliverables for the week, as well as the overall team's expected deliverables.
1. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?
    * I don't think there was any difficulties in interactions with my teammates.
1. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?
    * Right now, in the first sprint of the phase, I thought we are estimating the time of the current sprint well, and I think everyone expects their time for the project to be extended as the phase progresses.
1. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * As of now, it is only one big user, which would obviously cause concern for the customer as they are not individuals using the app. Also, once you post, the main page doesn't refresh automatically, which may cause concern for a user to be annoyed with that part of the interface.
1. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * I think the large amount of implementation that we need to do may cause concern, as we will most likely be utilizing the last sprint of the phase to be catching up on all the implementation and created a minimal viable app for this phase.
1. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * So far this sprint, we did not face a mountainous obstacle, just planning out everything and talking through our goals were difficult as it was something we haven't done before. But we talked through it together and was able to complete the planning and building artifacts aspect.
    * One obstacle was backlog, we figuring out how to have our flutter app be served on our dokku url.
