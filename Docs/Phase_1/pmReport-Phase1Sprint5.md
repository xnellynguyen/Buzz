## General questions [25 points]

1. How well did the team meet the requirements of this sprint?</br>
    All team components were completed. The video was made and uploaded with all the required deliverables. Which included system diagram, FSM, ERD, Web/Mobile user interface, routes, etc. They were all discussed together as a team and looked over for any additional feedback. 
    * Web/Mobile: Created a mock of what the web and mobile user interfaces would look like. Also created some unit tests for when the code is ready to be tested. Also successfully created a very basic page off previous tutorials.
    * Admin: Got user stories done and the unit test up and running successfully.
    * Backend: Connected to Dokku successfully
1. When is the team gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?</br>
	1. Thursday 9:00pm: General Meeting to work together as a group and discuss what is to be completed.
	2. Friday 11:30am: Meeting with mentor to ask any questions and discuss where everyone is currently on assigned tasks.
	3. Sunday 8:00pm: General Meeting to finalize any missing components and record our video together. 

2. Report on each member's progress (phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"</br>
	Everyone was able to complete the tasks they were given. Backend was able to connect to Dokku and create the app. Admin was able to begin creating the database needed. They also created their unit tests as well as some user stories and tests. Web/Mobile was able to start the very basics of their code while also creating unit tests themselves. Web/Mobile also created a design for the Mobile and Web user interfaces. PM just kept up to date with everyone.  

3. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"</br>
	Progress was constantly posted on slack by many team members. This way I, the PM, could keep track of what was being done along with the team. Additionally, if anything was posted on slack that needed to be added to the README.md file for this Sprint then I could take it from the slack channel. At the end of the week before our video was recorded we made sure to double check everything needed and add any missing items. 

4. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?</br>
    Due to this week being filled with many team members having multiple exams, I did not really push for them to get things done early as everyone was already stressed enough. Everyone completed most of their pressing exams by thursday so by then we all got to work and began to keep one another accountable for anything that needed to get done.

5. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?</br>
	The team didn’t need much encouragement this week as we all get along pretty well and are comfortable with one another. This allowed us all to be understanding when we all expressed confusion about some requirements. We also helped one another try to understand what was needed for this sprint along with asking our mentor. 

6. How well is the team communicating?</br>
The team is communicating effectively well throughout the two different forms of communication. For any formal group project related issues, questions, or completion slack is mostly utilized so that everyone may be informed. For any informal chats such as reminders on items needed to be done, imminent questions needing answers, or group meeting reminders, IMessage is used by the group.

7. What expectations have you set for one another, if any? Highlight any changes.</br>
Everyone in the group is expected to be present at any and all planned meetings, especially our weekly Friday meetings with our mentor Ayon. We also expect one another to communicate any troubles or issues and reach out to one another if we are in need of help. 

8. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please itemize and briefly describe the challenge, its status (resolved or unresolved), and critical steps taken to find resolution.</br>
Initially the group was unclear on what each role had to do for this week. We also had some confusion on how exactly we would create our System Diagram, our State Machine Diagram, and our ERD. We asked our mentor what exactly we had to do then got to work on our tasks. For example, the backend was unsure about their role. Our mentor let us know that they only needed to connect to Dokku this week and that was all they had to get done. For the diagrams we worked together to solve what they needed to look like and then all gave an opinion on whether they were sufficient. 


## Project Management [25 points]
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?</br>
	We met with our mentor on Friday March 3rd at 11:30pm for 30 minutes. 

2. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?</br>
	My use of trello was a bit messy as initially the group was a bit confused on some of the items certain roles had to get completed for the week. For the next sprint I plan to better title some name cards and potentially better create sub tasks than this sprint. 

3. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?</br>
	I didn’t really lead meetings, the team as a whole would just bring up what needed to get done and then we would all work on the items. If some objective only required a person or two then we would move onto the next and allow other group members to work on said item. We would also show one another the diagrams created so we could all judge the quality of our work and agree or disagree. 

4. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk?</br>
	Used trello to keep track of what was being done. We also met 3 times this week compared to our one weekly meeting to better check how we were doing on tasks and checking things off, 

5. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates? Were there any team issues that arose?</br>
	I initially felt overwhelmed by just how many tasks there were and having to mark them all down. I also missed some things in the deliverables files that needed to be added to the docs so when our group met to create our video I needed a minute to add some needed information to the README file for this sprint so that it could be in our repository. 

6. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?</br>
	I estimated that we could get things done in about 2-3 days and it was a bit of a time crunch as I didn’t want to pressure the group at the beginning of the week due to exams that were happening. 

7. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?</br>
	So far the team has done well on all needed tasks and is ready to begin implementing our ideas. The customer doesn’t need to worry about anything thus far. 

8. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?</br>
	My biggest concern is that I need to be better as the project manager as I felt that some team members were taking the lead more in leading the team. I am slightly concerned about us all going into Spring break after this week and my team and I want to finish our tasks before Saturday but everyone is responsible so we should be alright. 

9. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced. </br>
	The most significant obstacle has just been confusion on what exactly each role had to work on and report for this first week. Some instructions from the deliveries document stated tasks we needed to complete, such as code tests/reviews. However our mentor mentioned to us that we aren’t exactly coding just yet and so there were certain parts of the deliveries that did not apply to some roles in this sprint. Once we got started and met at the end of the week we overcame that obstacle and completed our team sprint better than expected.
